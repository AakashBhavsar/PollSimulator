 The objective of this lab is to appreciate factoring for “multi-tier application architecture”. It shows basics of election of SBG(Student body Governance) for an institute, where every student can vote.
 
 Steps:
  
  1) Clone this repository in your local system.
  2) Node modules are already installed, so to run project type "npm start".

Note:
Candidates can be added and students can vote once by providing student id.
Poll result will be public and everyone can see it but cannot see who voted whom.
Poll result will show winner and runner-up names with total number of votes received.
Business logic is present in "index.js" file and Presentation logic in "views" folder.
